A chat message is prefaced with
t!
and nominally uses the Qt HTML subset described at http://doc.qtsoftware.com/4.5/richtext-html-subset.html . It is possible for other markup to be included but it will be ignored.

An emote message is prefaced with
T!
and is otherwise the same as a normal chat message (though of course it displays differently).

A map file is prefaced with
n!
which also serves to mark the beginning of its name attribute. [later: insert more info about map format here]

Any change to users is prefaced with
u!

[the following require more information about the board/display before they can be completed]

Other alterations to the map might be prefaced with
m!

Communications relating to transferring an image (e.g. for a pog) are prefaced with
i!
[the nature of image transfer itself must be investigated]

A pog alteration request (placement, movement, ...) is prefaced with
p!
