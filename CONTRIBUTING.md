If you want to add or fix something in RGG, we'd be delighted by your help!
If you have any questions or need access to the repository, Doctus is the
most likely to respond, so try opening an issue or contacting her via
any of the methods listed in the readme.

This is an ancient project at this point, so don't worry about matching the 
style of existing code (it's bad and inconsistent anyway).
