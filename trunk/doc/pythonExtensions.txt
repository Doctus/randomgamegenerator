class bMain: //class containing all the functions to interface with random-game-generator

  bMain() //constructor, initialises window, network manager etc
  void start() //actually runs the program(shows the window etc), also blocks python script.
  void insertChatMessage(str) //inserts a chat message into the chat widget
  void sendChatMessageToAll(str) //sends a network message to all connected clients
  void sendChatMessageToHandle(str, handle) //sends str to the connection with the corresponding handle

  signals //meant to connect functions to. Not usable as regular functions.
  void newNetMessageSignal(str, handle) //is emitted when a new message is received through the connection to the host.
  void newChatInput(str) //is emitted when the user inputs text into the chat widget




how to connect to signals:

first, define a function with exactly the same amount of function arguments as the signal.
Suppose you want to connect a function to catch user input from the chat widget.

First you create an instance of the bMain class

bmain = bmainmod.bMain() //bmainmod is the module name of the python extensions

Then you define a function

void connectingFunctionToChatInput(str):
  print str

Then you tell python to connect it to the desired signal

bmain.newChatInput.connect(connectingfunctionToChatInput)

And last, but not least, you start the game!

bmain.start()

And you're done! Everytime the user inputs(and sbumits it!) the input is now routed to your function!
