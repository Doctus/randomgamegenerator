LINUX:

Get all appropriate stuff (most recent Ubuntu repository versions work, probably)

Open QtCreator
(Re?)build random-game-generator.pro

Go to src/Bindings and sh compile.sh

Copy qt4/librandom-game-generator.so.1.0.0 to scripts and rename to librandom-game-generator.so.1
Copy src/Bindings/_bmainmod.so to scripts

Be sure to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. before running rgg.py

MAC OSX:

Less of an idea.


WINDOWS:

Get specific version of pyQT
Qt creator, python 2.6
MSYS, MinGW

Open QtCreator
Build qt4/random-game-generator-windows.pro
Have to clean first for some reason

Navigate to src/Bindings in MSYS
run msys.sh

Two files that are built are:
qt4/release/random-game-generator.dll
src/Bindings/_bmainmod.pyd

Move those to the scripts dir.
Prebuilt ones are kept in scripts/windows
If using those, they need to be moved out to the scripts dir

Packaging hasn't been figured out yet....
