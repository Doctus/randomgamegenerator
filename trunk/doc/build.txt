LINUX:

No idea.

MAC OSX:

Less of an idea.


WINDOWS:

Get specific version of pyQT
Qt creator, python 2.6
MSYS, MinGW

Open QtCreator
Build qt4/random-game-generator-windows.pro
Have to clean first for some reason

Navigate to src/Bindings in MSYS
run msys.sh

Two files that are built are:
qt4/release/random-game-generator.dll
src/Bindings/_bmainmod.pyd

Move those to the scripts dir.
Prebuilt ones are kept in scripts/windows
If using those, they need to be moved out to the scripts dir

Packaging hasn't been figured out yet....
