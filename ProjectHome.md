RGG is a project designed to facilitate play of traditional pen-and-paper role-playing games online, providing features such as a chat window, a graphical display for terrain and "pogs" representing creatures and objects, and automated dice rolling. It also includes a wide variety of random generators so that one can, for example, generate randomized names with an appropriate sound for a large number of NPCs simultaneously. It is cross-platform and can be used even if every player is running a different OS.
